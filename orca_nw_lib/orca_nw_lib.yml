# Config parameters in this file can be overridden by setting them as environment variables with same name.
# In that case the property which are set in environment will be read from environment and not from this file, 
# and rest of the properties will be read from this file.
# For example if we set "discover_networks" like "export discover_networks="10.10.229.50,10.10.229.51", 
# discover_networks property will always be read from environment and not from this file but rest of the properties will be read from this file.

# device_ip(s) to start discovery with or subnet(s) in yml list format.
# After discovering the current device next LLDP neighbor is discovered if any.
# Then move forward to next device in the network.
discover_networks:
  # - "10.10.229.50"
  #- "10.10.10.1/24"
device_username: admin # username to make gNMI connection with device defined in network above
